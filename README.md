# Datasets of what causes cognitive effects
Simple datasets of what causes cognitive causes effects on humans in a friendly
format to consume via software and with a license that allows even commercial
use. This is a [Open Data for Open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science).

It is initially designed for use in software by one free personal
cognitive assistance software from the same author that for now is just one
hypothesis.

## What is Cognition
> Cognition is "the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and
> understanding through thought, experience, and the senses." It encompasses
> processes such as knowledge, attention, memory and working memory, judgment
> and evaluation, reasoning and "computation", problem solving and decision
> making, comprehension and production of language, etc. Human cognition is
> conscious and unconscious, concrete or abstract, as well as intuitive (like
> knowledge of a language) and conceptual (like a model of a language).
> Cognitive processes use existing knowledge and generate new knowledge.

## Motivation
[Emerson Rocha](https://github.com/fititnt) has [a hypothesis](https://github.com/fititnt/hipoteses-de-rocha)
that it would be  possible to create one or more
[Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)
with [Weak Artificial Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_AI)
to aid in [human cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognition) and that
this would be especially useful for people with some sort of temporary or
permanent disadvantage.
